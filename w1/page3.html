        <p>During this period, smartphones became more
            advanced with the introduction of 3G and 4G
            networks, allowing faster internet access. The
            Apple iPhone continued to dominate the market with
            new models and iOS updates, while Android emerged
            as a strong competitor with a variety of devices
            from different manufacturers. Features like
            high-resolution cameras, app stores, and mobile
            payments became standard. Notable devices include
            the iPhone 3G (2008), Samsung Galaxy S (2010),
            and Google Pixel (2016).</p>
        <p>The end of this era is marked by the transition to
            5G technology and the introduction of foldable
            smartphones.</p>
